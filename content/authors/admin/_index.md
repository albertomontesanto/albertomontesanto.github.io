I am a professor of genetics, currently working to (i) the analysis of the role of human nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence variations in human aging and longevity; (ii) the analysis of the role of epigenetic variability of nuclear and mitochondrial loci in human aging and longevity; (iii) develop new statistical methods for disentangling the complex genetic and epigenetic networks affecting the ageing process in human population; (iv) the analysis of DNA to predict externally visible characteristics of unknown sample donors or deceased persons on the basis of genetic and epigenetic markers (forensic DNA Phenotyping).
