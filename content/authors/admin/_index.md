I am a genetic researcher, currently working to improve the lives of post-deployment veterans. My primary therapeutic orientations are ACT and mindfulness-based interventions. I have had specialty training in the areas of trauma and substance use, but my interests are too broad to consider me a specialist. I also make online resources for data analysis.
