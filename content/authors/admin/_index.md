I am a professor of genetics, currently working to the analysis of the role of human nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (epi)genetic variations in human aging and longevity. My research interest is also focused on the analysis of DNA variability to predict externally visible characteristics of unknown sample donors or deceased persons on the basis of genetic and epigenetic markers (forensic DNA Phenotyping).
