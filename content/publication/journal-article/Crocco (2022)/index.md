abstract: 'Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease associated with long-term complications, with a multifactorial pathogenesis related to the interplay between genetic and modifiable risk factors, of which nutrition is the most relevant. In particular, the importance of proteins and constitutive amino acids (AAs) in disease susceptibility is emerging. The ability to sense and respond to changes in AA supplies is mediated by complex networks, of which AA transporters (AATs) are crucial components acting also as sensors of AA availability. This study explored the associations between polymorphisms in selected AATs genes and T2D and vascular complications in 433 patients and 506 healthy controls. Analyses revealed significant association of SLC38A3-rs1858828 with disease risk. Stratification of patients based on presence/absence of vascular complications highlighted significant associations of SLC7A8-rs3783436 and SLC38A7-rs9806843 with diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, the SLC38A9-rs4865615 resulted associated with chronic kidney disease. Notably, these genes function as AAs sensors, specifically glutamine, leucine, and arginine, linked to the main nutrient signaling pathway mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Thus, their genetic variability may contribute to T2D by influencing the ability to properly transduce a signal activating mTORC1 in response to AA availability. In this scenario, the contribution of dietary AAs supply to disease risk may be relevant.'
