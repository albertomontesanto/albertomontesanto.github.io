summary: DNA methylation variants have been widely used as biomarkers of ageing and several mathematical models have been developed to
estimate the biological age (1-4). More recently, DNA technology has triggered efforts toward the simplification of the array-based epigenetic
clocks and targeted approaches, based on the assessment of a small number of CpG sites, have been developed (5-6).
The aim of this work is to develop a cost-effective targeted epigenetic clock purposely optimized for the measurement of biological age. The
proposed clock was developed on a cohort of 104 healthy subjects (HS) and tested in several phenotypes of decreased (long-lived individuals
(LLI), 90+ years) or increased (Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Fabry’s disease (FD)) biological age.
