abstract: 'Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is a multi-protein complex belonging to the innate immune system, whose activation by danger stimuli promotes inflammatory cell death. Evidence supports the crucial role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the transition of acute kidney injury to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), by promoting both inflammation and fibrotic processes. Variants of NLRP3 pathway-related genes, such as NLRP3 itself and CARD8, have been associated with susceptibility to different autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated for the first time the association of functional variants of NLRP3 pathway-related genes (NLRP3-rs10754558, CARD8-rs2043211), with a susceptibility to CKD. A cohort of kidney transplant recipients, dialysis and CKD stage 3-5 patients (303 cases) and a cohort of elderly controls (85 subjects) were genotyped for the variants of interest and compared by using logistic regression analyses. Our analysis showed a significantly higher G allele frequency of the NLRP3 variant (67.3%) and T allele of the CARD8 variant (70.8%) among cases, compared with the control sample (35.9 and 31.2%, respectively). Logistic regressions showed significant associations (p < 0.001) between NLRP3 and CARD8 variants and cases. Our results suggest that the NLRP3 rs10754558 and CARD8 rs2043211 variants could be associated with a susceptibility to CKD.'
