	abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the international literature, the percentage of nursing home (NH) residents with renal insufficiency is very high, ranging between 22 and  78\%. Diminished kidney function represents a risk factor for drug overdosage,  adverse drug reactions, end-stage renal disease, disability, morbidity, and  mortality. Several studies suggested that screening for chronic kidney disease  (CKD) in high-risk and older populations may represent a cost-effective approach  to reducing progression to renal failure and CKD mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study  aimed (i) to investigate to what extent CKD may be staged interchangeably by  three different creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  equations in a sample of older adults living in long-term care facilities; (ii)  to investigate factors explaining differences among eGFR equations; and (iii) to  compare the predictivity of different creatinine-based eGFR equations with  respect to all-cause mortality. METHODS: A total of 522 residents aged 65 years  and older participated in a prospective cohort study of 9 long-term care  facilities in Calabria. eGFR was calculated by Chronic Kidney Disease  Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), Berlin initiative study (BIS), and full age  spectrum (FAS) equations. Disability in at least one activity of daily living  (ADL), depression, cognitive impairment, comorbidity, and malnutrition was  considered in the analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out by Bland-Altman  analysis, and 2-year mortality was investigated by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox  regression analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the adopted equation, the prevalence  of NH residents with impaired renal function (eGFR {\textless} 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) ranged  between 58.2\% for the CKD-EPI and 79.1\% for the BIS1 equation. The average  difference between BIS and FAS was nearly negligible (0.45 ml/min/1.73 m(2)),  while a significant bias was detected between CKD-EPI and BIS and also between  CKD-EPI and FAS (6.21 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 6.65 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively).  Although the eGFR study equations had comparable prognostic accuracy in terms of  mortality risk, BIS and FAS were able to reclassify NH residents pertaining to a  low-risk group with CKD-EPI, and this reclassification improves the  discriminative capacity of CKD-EPI with respect to overall mortality. CONCLUSION:  Despite the relatively good correlation between eGFRs calculated using all  adopted equations, the findings in this study reported clearly demonstrated that  CKD-EPI and BIS/FAS equations are not interchangeable to assess eGFR among older  people and particularly in institutionalized and frail older subjects.},
