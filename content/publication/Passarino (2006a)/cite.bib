\{\\textless\}AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS"\{\\textgreater\}First, on the basis of a synthetic survival curve constructed using historic mortality data taken from the Italian population from 1890 onward, we defined three age classes ranging from 18 to 106 years. Second, we assembled a multinomial logistic regression model to evaluate the effect of dichotomous variables (genotypes) on the probability to be assigned to a specific category (age class). Third, we applied the regression model to a cross-sectional dataset (10 genes; 972 subjects selected for healthy status) categorized according to age and sex.\{\\textless\}/AbstractText\{\\textgreater\}\
\{\\textless\}AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS"\{\\textgreater\}We found that genetic factors influence survival at advanced age in good health in a sex- and age-specific way. Furthermore, we found that genetic variability plays a stronger role in males than in females and that, in both genders, its impact is especially important at very old ages.\{\\textless\}/AbstractText\{\\textgreater\}\
