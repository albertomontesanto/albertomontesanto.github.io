	abstract = {Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  have been associated with the individual variability in blood lipid profile and  response to lipid-lowering treatments. Here, we genotyped 34 selected SNPs  located in coding genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, coagulation,  and a polymorphism in the MIR499 gene-a microRNA previously linked to CVD-to  evaluate the association with lipid trait in subjects with moderate dyslipidemia  not on lipid-lowering treatment (Treatment-na√Øve (TN) cohort, n = 125) and in  patients treated with statins (STAT cohort, n = 302). We also explored the  association between SNPs and the effect of a novel phytochemical lipid-lowering  treatment in the TN cohort. We found that 6 SNPs (in the MIR499, TNFA, CETP,  SOD2, and VEGFA genes) were associated with lipid traits in the TN cohort, while  no association was found with the response to twelve-week phytochemical  treatment. In the STAT cohort, nine SNPs (in the MIR499, CETP, CYP2C9, IL6,  ABCC2, PON1, IL10, and VEGFA genes) were associated with lipid traits, three of  which were in common with the TN cohort. Interestingly, in both cohorts, the  presence of the rs3746444 MIR499 SNP was associated with a more favorable blood  lipid profile. Our findings could add information to better understand the  individual genetic variability in maintaining a low atherogenic lipid profile and  the response to different lipid-lowering therapies.},
