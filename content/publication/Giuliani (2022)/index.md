abstract: 'SDisorders of lipoprotein metabolism are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with the individual variability in blood lipid profile and response to lipid-lowering treatments. Here, we genotyped 34 selected SNPs located in coding genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, coagulation, and a polymorphism in the MIR499 gene—a microRNA previously linked to CVD—to evaluate the association with lipid trait in subjects with moderate dyslipidemia not on lipid-lowering treatment (Treatment-naïve (TN) cohort, n = 125) and in patients treated with statins (STAT cohort, n = 302). We also explored the association between SNPs and the effect of a novel phytochemical lipid-lowering treatment in the TN cohort. We found that 6 SNPs (in the MIR499, TNFA, CETP, SOD2, and VEGFA genes) were associated with lipid traits in the TN cohort, while no association was found with the response to twelve-week phytochemical treatment. In the STAT cohort, nine SNPs (in the MIR499, CETP, CYP2C9, IL6, ABCC2, PON1, IL10, and VEGFA genes) were associated with lipid traits, three of which were in common with the TN cohort. Interestingly, in both cohorts, the presence of the rs3746444 MIR499 SNP was associated with a more favorable blood lipid profile. Our findings could add information to better understand the individual genetic variability in maintaining a low atherogenic lipid profile and the response to different lipid-lowering therapies.'
