              Background
              Elevated cholesterol levels and systemic inflammation are considered relevant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development and progression. Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol-lowering and inflammation-lowering nutraceuticals are useful in the management of moderate hypercholesterolemia. Here, we describe the study protocol of a clinical trial aimed to evaluate the cholesterol and inflammatory lowering effect of an innovative dietary supplement (BruMeChol™, Mivell S.r.l., Italy), composed of a mixture of extracts of bergamot and olive fruits in association with vitamin K2 in subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia.
            
            
              Methods
              
                The study was planned as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial for 12 weeks at the Cardiology Unit of the IRCCS INRCA of Ancona, Italy. A total of 125 subjects (age ≥ 40 years) with mild hypercholesterolemia (total serum cholesterol levels ≥ 200 and ≤ 250 mg/dl) will be recruited. Intervention arm participants will take one capsule of dietary supplement two times a day, 15 min before the main meal. Control arm participants will receive one capsule of placebo in the same way. The dietary supplement capsule contains the following ingredients: phytosterols, flavonoid-rich extract of bergamot fruit (
                Citrus bergamia
                ), flavonoid-rich extract of olive fruit (
                Olea europaea
                ), and vitamin K2. Participants will undergo a medical evaluation and chemical-clinical examinations, which include lipid profile, glycemia, biomarkers of renal, liver and cardiac/muscular functions, interleukins (IL 6, IL-32, IL-37, and IL-38), and innovative mediators of inflammation such as inflamma-miRs (miR-21 and miR-146a), at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The decrease in total cholesterol levels and inflammatory biomarkers will be the primary and secondary endpoints of the study.
              
            
            
              Discussion
              This protocol study, planned to verify the effects of BruMeChol™ dietary supplementation in subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia, could also contribute to new study designs for next large-scale multicenter clinical trials.
