## Course Description

This is a survey course in comparative political economy, a ﬁeld of inquiry within the subﬁeld of comparative politics that explores the interaction of politics and the economy. Comparative political economy is one of the most active research ﬁelds in comparative politics and is comprised of a wide range of research topics. Frequently the focus of research in comparative political economy is on how institutions inﬂuence economic outcomes. How, for example, do property rights facilitate investment and economic growth? How dodifferent colonial legaciesinhibitor promote economic performance? Sometimes, however, institutions become the dependent variable in our analysis. Howdoes wealth inﬂuence regime stability? Or how does economicglobalization affect welfare states? This course will address questions like these through an exploration of relevant literature. The syllabus emphasizes current research agendas in political economy, and its main goal is to provide students with a broad overview of contemporary debates in the ﬁeld.

## Learning Objectives

Students in this course should strive to meet the following specific objectives: appreciate the importance of genetics to health and disease; to construct and interpret a family history in the form of a pedigree; to explain the recurrence risk for each form of inheritance for individuals in the family.
