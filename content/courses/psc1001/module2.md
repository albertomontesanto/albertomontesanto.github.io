## Content

In **module 2**, we will be discussing about Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We will begin our discussion by addressing some basic definitions about this kind of stydy. First of all, we will discuss about the methods to carry out. We will discuss about the "missing heritability" problem. We will discuss on the fact that associations detected by GWAS are valid at the population level, but for most conditions they have little clinical utility for predicting risks at individual level. Finally, we will discuss about the achievements and limitations of GWAS in identifying susceptibility factors for common complex conditions.
