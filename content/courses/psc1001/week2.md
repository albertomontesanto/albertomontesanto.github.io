## Content

In **module 2.1**, we will be discussing state capacity and state building. We will begin our discussion by addressing some basic definitional questions about states. First of all, what is a state? How is this concept used in the field of comparative politics and how should we define it? What does it mean to say that a state has more or less capacity? What aspects of state capacity are we most concerned with in our analysis of modern nation-states? Finally, what does it mean to say that a state is ‘fragile’ or that a state has ‘failed’? What are some examples of failed states and what are some the implications of state failure and fragility?

In **module 2**, we will be discussing on human genetic variation, DNA extraction and quantification.
