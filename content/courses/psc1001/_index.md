## Course Description

Genetic variability and its consequences. Mitochondrial genetics. Epigenetics. Association studies on a wide scale. Personalized medicine: test for the susceptibility to complex diseases. Introduction to forensic genetics.

## Learning Objectives

Specific objectives: by the end of the course, the student should be able to:
appreciate the importance of genetics to health and disease; to construct and interpret a family history in the form of a pedigree; to explain the recurrence risk for each form of inheritance for individuals in the family. The students will also become familiar with multiple approaches to the analysis of complex traits; able to analyze and solve problems related to the analysis of DNA profiling for individual identification and parentage analyses.
Transversal skills, and in particular:
- ability to solve problems through the analysis of case-studies;
- capability to collaborate in small groups, sharing and showing the work done;
- ability to integrate the knowledge acquired during human genetics courses to analyze and understand some current research topics of modern genetics research.
