## Course Description
The Applied Human Genetics course is structured in four parts. The first part aims at making students familiar with human genetic variability and its consequences. The second part analyzes the methodological issues and new developments in the context of Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). The third part aims at making students familiar with the personalized medicine and in particular with testing for susceptibility to complex diseases. Finally, the purpose of the last  topic is to analyze the most recent advances in forensic DNA. Modern DNA typing technology has opened new possibilities to perform human identity testing for the determination of perpetrators of violent crimes such as murder and sexual assault, and identification of remains of missing persons or victims of mass disasters and paternity testing.

## Learning Objectives

Specific objectives: by the end of the course, the student should be able to:
appreciate the importance of genetics to health and disease; to construct and interpret a family history in the form of a pedigree; to explain the recurrence risk for each form of inheritance for individuals in the family. The students will also become familiar with multiple approaches to the analysis of complex traits; able to analyze and solve problems related to the analysis of DNA profiling for individual identification and parentage analyses.
Transversal skills:
- ability to solve problems through the analysis of case-studies;
- capability to collaborate in small groups, sharing and showing the work done;
- ability to integrate the knowledge acquired during human genetics courses to analyze and understand some current research topics of modern genetics research.
