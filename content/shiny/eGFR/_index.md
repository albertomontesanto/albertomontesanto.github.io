## Course Description

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important epidemic and public health problem, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. CKD is currently classified into five stages based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as recommended by many professionalguidelines. Measurement of renal function is important in the diagnosis and management of renal diseases. GFR is the standard measure of renal function.Equations have been proposed in order to provide the physician an easy way of calculation and an accurate estimation of kidney function. Some of these have been implemented here.
